- **✅ Documentation**: Comprehensive comments and WHO GLASS compliance notes
- **✅ Export structure**: Organized export to `dashboard_exports/` directory

#### Data Integration
- **✅ Reference file usage**: Proper integration of organism and antimicrobial metadata
- **✅ Quality metrics**: Uses comprehensive quality reports from data cleaning pipeline
- **✅ Compliance validation**: Leverages WHO GLASS compliance assessments
- **✅ Standardized outputs**: All exports follow consistent format and naming

### 4. WHO GLASS Compliance Features

#### Data Quality Standards
- **✅ Essential field validation**: Checks for WHO GLASS essential fields
- **✅ Quality thresholds**: Implements proper minimum data quality requirements
- **✅ Completeness scoring**: Calculates WHO GLASS compliance scores
- **✅ Geographic coverage**: Proper facility and regional coverage analysis

#### Reporting Standards
- **✅ Standard age categories**: Uses WHO GLASS age groupings
- **✅ Specimen type mapping**: Proper GLASS specimen type classifications
- **✅ Resistance thresholds**: Implements WHO GLASS resistance rate thresholds
- **✅ Priority pathogen focus**: Emphasizes WHO priority organisms

## Files Generated and Updated
